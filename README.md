### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

The topics disscussed me helped prepare me. However the modal overlay gave me difficulties in implementing and populating it.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
I would have added feautures like a search button, add playlist, and delete 

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

  Creating the playlist cards on the home page went well for me. however, i was unable to successfully implement my modal structure. Overall, I have learnt a lot and will do better in my next project.
